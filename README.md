# TrueTokenTracker

## Purpose 

The function of this app is to implement a centralized tracker for creature tokens in *Magic: The Gathering*.
The app works by allocating creatures of the same type into a stack that can then be deleted or modified.

The app allows for creation of multiple creature tokens with any creature type and the fifteen most common keyword
abilities in *Magic: The Gathering*. Adding a photo related to the token stack is currently in development.
